# Pehelper

Dotnet Core MVC project, excercise MVC approach with the real task.

>The purpose of creating Pehelper was to support mass item upload to the Creo's Windchill, to save engineering time. The app supports .xls or .xls file. 

## How Pehelper is built

PE Helper, is a web app, built using Dotnet Core 2.1 and MVC frameworks. Also I used a [NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) library on the back-end, to read posted Excel files. PE Helper, an engineering tool, extracts componentsâ€™ index from an Excel file, serializes, separates each of them using semicolon and finally splits into desired groups and displayed as rows.

### Design approach

- It is going to be mainly a single page app.
- Excel file will be posted to the server and saved to the Temp project folder.
- Saved file is read and then deleted.
- Read data are stored in cookies.
- Use Bootstrap for styling, is a part of ASP.NET MVC project
